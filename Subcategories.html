<h3>Instruction set architecture (ISA): defines the machine code that a processor reads and acts upon as well as the word size, memory address modes, processor registers, and data type.<h3>
<h3>Microarchitecture: also known as "computer organization", this describes how a particular processor will implement the ISA.The size of a computer's CPU cache for instance, is an issue that generally has nothing to do with the ISA.<h3>
<h3>Systems design: includes all of the other hardware components within a computing system, such as data processing other than the CPU (e.g., direct memory access), virtualization, and multiprocessing<h3>
<h3>There are other technologies in computer architecture. The following technologies are used in bigger companies like Intel, and were estimated in 2002[13] to count for 1% of all of computer architecture:<h3>
<h3>Macroarchitecture: architectural layers more abstract than microarchitecture<h3>
<h3>Assembly instruction set architecture: A smart assembler may convert an abstract assembly language common to a group of machines into slightly different machine language for different implementations.<h3>
<h3>Programmer-visible macroarchitecture: higher-level language tools such as compilers may define a consistent interface or contract to programmers using them, abstracting differences between underlying ISA, UISA, and microarchitectures. For example, the C, C++, or Java standards define different programmer-visible macroarchitectures.<h3>
<h3>UISA: User Instruction Set Architecture, refers to one of three subsets of the RISC CPU instructions provided by PowerPC RISC Processors. The UISA subset, are those RISC instructions of interest to application developers. The other two subsets are VEA (Virtual Environment Architecture) instructions used
